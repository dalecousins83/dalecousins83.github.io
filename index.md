## Thoughts on decentralisation across industries and culture
The first time I read ```Thinking in Systems``` by Donella Meadows there were many things I found interesting, but one quote always stood out to me:

> A system just can’t respond to short-term changes when it has long term delays. That’s why a massive central-planning system, such as the Soviet Union or General Motors, necessarily functions poorly.

This rang true on many levels and has impacted every aspect of my life, from my political views, to my views on business, technology, and life in general - its one of the main drivers in why I'm so fascinated by decentralisation.

I like things to be clean, simple, and effective - things that our world rarely is. These things are often at-odds with human nature. We build structures to support the ego of those who control the system, we prioritise profits over beauty, we do things the way they've always been done just because we're afraid of change. Decentralisation goes against many of these, but it also places a responsibility upon the people in the system - one that people who, from an end-user perspective,  'just want to use the system' want to avoid. I want to explore and document my thoughts on decentralisation across industries, technologies, and aspects of normal life to see if there's a better way.

More to come...
