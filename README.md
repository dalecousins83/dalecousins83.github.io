## Thoughts on decentralisation across industries and culture
The first time I read ```Thinking in Systems``` by Donella Meadows, one quote always stood out to me:

> A system just can’t respond to short-term changes when it has long term delays. That’s why a massive central-planning system, such as the Soviet Union or General Motors, necessarily functions poorly.

This thought has impacted every aspect of my life, from my political views, to my views on businesses, technology, and life in general. This is one of the main drivers in why I'm so fascinated by decentralisation. I like things to be clean, simple, and effective - things that our world rarely is. These things are often at-odds with human nature.
